Insufficient (May likely result in DENIAL)
Mr. Smith is a male, age 72, with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who over the
last few weeks has been having more Shortness of Breath (SOB). He states he is unable to walk
for me today because he is too tired. Therefore he needs a PMD.
Sufficient (May likely result in an APPROVAL if other requirements are met)
Mr. Smith is a 72 yo male with COPD, worsening gradually over the past year despite compliant
use of XYZ meds, nebulizers and rescue inhalers. PFT’s (attached) demonstrate the decline in
lung function over the last 12 months. Now with the constant use of 2-3L NC O2 at home for the
last month, he still can no longer walk to the bathroom, about 30 feet from his bed without
significant SOB and overall discomfort. The kitchen is further from his bed. He says his bed/bath
doorways and halls are wide enough for a scooter that will bring him to his toilet, sink and
kitchen, all of which are on the same floor. VS 138/84, Ht rate 88 RR 16 at rest on 3L NC
Vision- sufficient to read newspaper with glasses on
Cognition- OX3. Able to answer my questions without difficulty.
Ht XX Wt YY
Ambulation – Sit to stand was done without difficulty. Patient attempted to ambulate 50’ in
hallway, but needed to stop and rest 2 x’s before he could accomplish. HR at first stop point
(about 25’) was 115 and RR was 32. Patient became slightly diaphoretic.
Lung exam – Hyperresonant percussion and distant breath sounds throughout. Occ wheezes.
Neuro- Hand grips of normal strength bilat. Patient able to maintain sit balance when laterally
poked. Steps carefully around objects in the room.
Alternative MAE equipment – Pt has attempted to use cane, walker or manual wheelchair
unsuccessfully due to extreme fatigue with slight exertion described above.
Assessment – Pt seems good candidate for a scooter to carry him the necessary distances in his
home to use toilet/sink and kitchen facilities. Home seems amenable to this device.
